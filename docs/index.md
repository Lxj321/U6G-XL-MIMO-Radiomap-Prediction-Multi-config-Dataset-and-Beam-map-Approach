## Overview

Radiomap prediction is a fundamental capability for future wireless systems, especially in **U6G / XL-MIMO** scenarios where large arrays, multiple operating frequencies, and diverse transmitter configurations introduce strong variation across deployment conditions. To support reproducible research in this setting, this project provides a **multi-configuration radiomap benchmark** with unified task definitions, released data assets, pretrained checkpoints, and open-source code.

The benchmark is designed to study practical prediction settings including:

* radiomap estimation without field measurements
* sparse-input radiomap reconstruction
* generalization across unseen transmitter configurations
* transfer across unseen environments

By releasing both the benchmark resources and the end-to-end reproducibility pipeline, this project aims to support fair comparison, transparent evaluation, and follow-up research on radiomap learning for next-generation wireless systems.

## Released Resources

The public release includes:

* **Radiomaps** for all benchmarked transmitter configurations
* **Height maps** for geometry-aware learning
* **Beam maps** as configuration-dependent side information
* **Configuration files** describing transmitter settings
* **Ray-tracing scenes and simulation-related settings**
* **Pretrained models** for the benchmark tasks
* **Training and evaluation code**
* **Dataset generation pipeline**

These resources are organized so that users can either directly evaluate released checkpoints, retrain models under the benchmark protocol, or inspect the full data-generation workflow.
