# U6G XL-MIMO Radiomap Prediction: Multi-config Dataset & Beam Map Approach

A benchmark project for **multi-configuration radiomap prediction** in **U6G / XL-MIMO** systems, featuring **800 scenes**, **multi-frequency**, **multi-antenna**, and **multi-beam** settings.

> **Preview mode:** This website is currently in a pre-release state.  
> Public release of the dataset, code, pretrained models, and paper links will be announced later.

## Overview

This project is designed for studying:

- **multi-configuration radiomap prediction**
- **cross-configuration generalization**
- **cross-environment generalization**
- **beam-aware radiomap modeling**
- **sparse radiomap reconstruction**

A key feature of this project is the joint design of:

- **height maps**
- **configuration-only beam maps**
- **ray-tracing radiomap labels**
- **optional mesh assets for ray-tracing reproduction**
- **UNet / GAN baseline pipelines**

---

## Current Status

The project website has been set up for documentation preview.

At this stage:

- dataset files are **not yet publicly released**
- source code is **not yet publicly released**
- pretrained checkpoints are **not yet publicly released**
- the paper is **not yet submitted / publicly available**

The current website is intended to:

- preview the dataset structure
- preview benchmark task definitions
- preview pretrained model organization
- help finalize documentation before public release

---

## What Will Be Released

The planned public release will include:

- **Dataset** (`Dataset/`)
  - height maps
  - radiomaps
  - configuration-only beam maps
  - optional mesh assets
- **Baselines**
  - UNet training / evaluation scripts
  - GAN training / evaluation scripts
- **Pretrained models** (`Pretrained_Model/`)
  - GAN checkpoints for 8 benchmark tasks
  - UNet checkpoints and visualizations
- **Dataset generation pipeline**
  - OSM → Sionna meshes → height maps → ray-tracing radiomaps → beam maps
